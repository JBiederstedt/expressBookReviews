# üìö Book Review Application

This project is part of the [IBM Full Stack Software Developer Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-full-stack-cloud-developer) on Coursera.

The Book Review Application is a web-based platform that allows users to register, log in, and interact with a collection of books by leaving reviews. The application features a secure REST API with JWT-based authentication and session management, allowing users to add, view, and delete their reviews.

## üì¶ Project Structure

The application consists of the following main components:

- **User Authentication**: Uses JWT and sessions to manage secure logins for users.
- **Book Data**: Static book collection with titles, authors, and reviews, which can be filtered and searched by various parameters (ISBN, title, author).
- **Review Management**: Users can add, update, and delete their reviews for books.
- **REST API**: Implements CRUD operations to handle books and reviews.
- **Async/Await and Promises**: Asynchronous functionality for API calls and data fetching.
- **Deployment**: Hosted locally for testing and development.
